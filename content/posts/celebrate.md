# The future is written in code. 
Our cars, clothes, games, phones, food, pets, travel...everything is surrounded by code written by people like you. That means we need to celebrate those passionate about making the world better through code, and about getting better at coding! Coding is a trade that must be continually mastered. When you meet a coder, you've met a person that's committed to continous life-long learning! Celebrate!
